NS Account finding extension for Google's Chrome web browser

On any NS account's home page (Dashboard), the extension will get the Account number from the comments at the bottom of the page and add it to the Home page, next to the version and copyright message. 

That extension just reads the comments from any NS dashboard's source, finds the Account # and adds it to the footer info already on the page. 
 
The native NetSuite home page footer looks like this:

And with the extension, this info is added:

 Enjoy!
